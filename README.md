# My-Expectations-And-Challenges
Am Baliyah Kanu a third year Computer Science Student at the University of Makeni located at Makeni, Sierra Leone.
So far So good it has been a bumpy ride but I was up for it So am Grateful.

Firstly, I've learned alot and there's still alot more for me to learn.  
More importantly My assumption for this Semester is much more high than the previous semester because I believe this stage will play a big part to my Career path and am more focus as always, ready to give my lecturers the best and put on my best behavior aswell 
   
Some of the Constraints am facing are 
 
*Poor internet facility - As Computer Science Student we all know how important the internet is to us. The internet is a must for us.   

*My Computer is Malfunctioning and most of  the Lab Computers are not working aswell.  

So it's Some how though for me but I've been through worst so am ready to give my best with the limited resources that I have so that I can achieve what am here for. 
Am looking forward for a wonderful Semester and a wonderful Academic year Aswell.  

Thank you!!
